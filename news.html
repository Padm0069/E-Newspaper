            <p>At the meeting, which went on for over six hours, the governing council discussed four key agenda items — crop diversification and achieving self-sufficiency in pulses, oilseeds and other agri-commodities; implementation of National Education Policy (NEP) in school education; implementation of NEP in higher education; and urban governance.

                Chief ministers of some non-BJP ruled states asked the Centre not to “force” its policies but to strengthen cooperative federalism and also sought a five-year extension for the compensation paid to states for revenue shortfall due to GST implementation.

					<p>Among the steps being taken by NTA are sending question papers early to the examination centers, keeping back-up servers ready, launching an additional grievance redressal email ID, and deploying officials outside the centres to provide support to students and parents, an official said.

                        University Grants Commission (UGC) chairperson M Jagadesh Kumar said there were indications of “sabotage” in the conduct of the exam and that tests at certain centres were cancelled keeping the best interest of students in mind. Kumar said strict action will be taken against anyone involved in “wilful sabotage” of the process. </p>
